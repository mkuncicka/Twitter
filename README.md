# Twitter
<p>My first web application similar to Twitter. App was created during workshops on backend boot-camp (CodersLab).</p>
<p> App was written only for practice purpose.</p>

#### Usage of the app
<p>App is based on the idea of social media. You has to register and log in to use it. The idea of it is based on Twitter.
</p>
<ul>After login:
<li>you can write a post</li>
<li>you can comment your posts and other users posts</li>
<li>you can visit your's and other user's home pages where you see all tweets posted by this user</li>
<li>clicking on a tweet redirects you to the tweet's page - you can see it's comments</li>
<li>you can send message to other users, and view those messages (view as conversation - at once you can see only 
messages you exchanged with one person)</li>
</ul>
